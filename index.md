## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="rajat.jpeg">

Hi! I am pursuing Master's in Computer Science student at University of Colorado Boulder and am currently in the second year. Prior to this I have I did Bachelor's in Information Technology at Vellore Institute of Technology, Vellore. I have more than three years of work experience working for a startup company named Fastfox in India. I worked there as a full-stack developer. Apart from that I did an internship at Apple in Summer 2020 as a full-stack developer as well.

## Research Interest

My research interests are broadly in Natural Language Processing, Deep Learning and Machine Learning. I am currently working in the [NALA lab](https://nala-cub.github.io/) under the guidance of Professor Katharina Kann. I am also working with Professor Chenhao Tan in the NLP-CSS Lab at CU Boulder. I wish to research interpretable machine learning and to find out answers to questions like what kind of information is represented in embedding vectors and can we teach a model to understand just a few 100 words properly.

## Projects

1. [Toxicity Classifier](http://detoxify.machineintheloop.com) (2020) - Used BERT for classifying toxic comments in Reddit. Developed a website where the moderators can delete the toxic comments. Integrated with the several subreddits. Also highlighted the key tokens due to which the decision was made by the classifier. [Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GLFzFjl7X7o)
2. A survey of neural machine translation for low-resource languages. Trained LSTM for 26 languages using low-resource hyperparameters.
3. [Chatting Website](http://negotiation.machineintheloop.com) (2020) A website for group chat.
4. [Sniper](https://youtu.be/d72DzrDAfFM) (2019) - Made a system to prevent Denial of Service attacks by blocking the IP address of the attacker. Technologies used - docker, nginx plus, elastic search, elastalert, kibana, filebeats.
5. Paper publication on [MapReduce Based Frequent Itemset Mining Algorithm on Stream Data](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/289124517_MapReduce_Based_Frequent_Itemset_Mining_Algorithm_on_Stream_Data) (2015)
6. Published Windows Mobile Apps and Windows Desktop Apps (2013 - 2015) - Integration+, My Dictionary, VIT Academia and My Today's Horoscope
